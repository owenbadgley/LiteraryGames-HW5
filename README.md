REFLECTION WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO

  This week's homework was the best I've done on one so far. All of the problems made sense, and I managed to do them without much trouble. 
Unfortunately I didn't have the time to do the bosses, but next week I'll do my best to figure out some more about Godot. I really enjoy 
working in it, and I want to be able to do a lot more in it. Maybe I'll even been able to make a game by the end of the semester. That would be
pretty fun.
  Even though the coding wasn't the most challenging part of this week for me, I really enjoyed Unpacking. I thought that the method of 
storytelling was extremely compelling. It was so well intertwined with the reading for this week also. The way that the game uses props to 
make you believe a story that it never tells is incredibly smart and well done. I never thought that a little purple cup getting cracked could 
get an emotional response out of me, but it did. The scene where you aren't able to put your degree on the wall is very immersive for a point
and click game. With absolutely no input other than props, Unpacking makes you feel underappreciated, and then pulls you back in and makes you
feel content again.
  I thought while reading it that Walton was not making sense with his arguments about make believe. I get where he is coming from when he's 
talking about an abstract of an object, I think that that is make believe. However, I disagreed with his thesis about metaphors. I don't 
think that calling the shoulder of the road a shoulder is make believe, because that is so far removed from thinking about an actual 
shoulder that it no longer is make believe. Anyway, I liked his argument as it related to Unpacking and about no further. Unpacking was 
incredible.
